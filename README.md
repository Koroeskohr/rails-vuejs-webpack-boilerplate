# Rails VueJS ES6 Webpack boilerplate

Shitty but working integration of the [VueJS official webpack-simple boilerplate](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple) in an empty Ruby on Rails project. 

## Note
This was made in a hurry, it has a Static Pages controller and its index action and view.
I don't even know how it works with Sprockets and Turbolinks, so use with caution.

## Gems used
- [webpack-rails](https://github.com/mipearson/webpack-rails)
- [vuejs-rails](https://github.com/adambutler/vuejs-rails)
